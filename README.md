# Lowtechs Anonymous

Albuquerque Lowtechs Anonymous (ALA!) is an underground hacker collective for cyber-security professionals and tech enthusiasts. We meet in the basement of a speakeasy once a month to share projects we're working on, drink, and talk tech. 

### Purpose:

This site is a webpage to represent Lowtechs Anonymous, display the next event date, redirect users to important information, and serve some of our projects.

### Sitemap: 

- `@/` Site Homepage, displays the date of next event
- `@/event` Redirects to the ALA! eventbrite page
- `@/discord` Redirects to the ALA! discord server invite
